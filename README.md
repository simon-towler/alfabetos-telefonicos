# alfabetos-telefonicos

AlfabetosTelefonicos is to be a small utility program that when given the text of your name as input will output the Spanish name of each letter in it, and the telephone alphabet phrase corresponding to that letter. 

For example, input of "Joe" should produce the outpu:

"Joe: jota de José, o de Oviedo, e de España."

One of the challenges when living in a Spanish-speaking country is to give your non-Spanish name over the phone correctly to officials and utility companies, etc. You need to spell it to the person you are talking to. Often you must do this yourself, because the legalities of creating a contract require that you do. To do it, you need to know the names of the letters of the Spanish alphabet, and you need to pronounce them so the other person can understand them. There is another aid to this type of communication, and that is to use a telephone alphabet, where you give letters in the style of "A for Apple, B for Banana" etc. There are telephone alphabets specific to Spanish.
